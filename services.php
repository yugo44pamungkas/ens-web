                    ENS provides consultancy on Network optimization where in we study the network architecture, check the BSS Statistics, Cell database set parameters, Dual band/triple band implementation methodology, congestion relief criterions, coverage and interference analysis, Drive test measurements, customer complaints and other problems faced in the network. Many networks have their own benchmarks for drop call rate, call success rate etc. we with our expert skills and tools try to achieve the highest possible set benchmarks. And till date we have proven our mettle in all the network optimization jobs taken so far.

                <p class="post__body">
                    This could be clubbed with the network optimization project where drive test optimization is a part but this can also be taken as a different project altogether where we conduct multiple network drive test and provide measurement and analysis of our customer's network compared to the competitor's network and find out advantages, strong points, black spots etc. in all the networks. A thematic plot and the statistics generated from drive test are analyzed. This gives an insight into the areas of improvement needed in client's network compared to competitor and where are the locations where roaming coverage can be enhanced etc. All these data are very important for the service provider to know the reality of the network performance on ground.

                <p class="post__body">
                    To ensure adequate strength and quality of wireless signals, it is essential to have a dedicated in-building solution. Similarly for other wireless services such as Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, Wireless Broadband, etc. such a dedicated Infrastructure is the need of the hour. And with 3G on the horizon, the need for a dedicated communication infrastructure is now more than ever. Additionally, such infrastructure should be capable of supporting multiple operators.

                    Evantama has the ability to upgrade to multiple projects, mainly due to its strong project management and implementation capabilities. evantama will always closely monitor the work process in the field and reduce human error which cuts time and effort to determine low cost project options. Fewer errors mean less site visits and we ensure the benchmark one-time installs. This allows lower labor costs for network deployments and reduces the time and cost of changing processes.
